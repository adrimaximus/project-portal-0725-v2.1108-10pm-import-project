AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
You can perform several types of actions. When you decide to perform an action, you MUST respond ONLY with a JSON object in the specified format.

1. CREATE_PROJECT:
{"action": "CREATE_PROJECT", "project_details": {"name": "<project name>", "description": "<desc>", "start_date": "YYYY-MM-DD", "due_date": "YYYY-MM-DD", "venue": "<venue>", "budget": 12345, "services": ["Service 1"], "members": ["User Name"]}}
- The current user will be the project owner. 'members' are additional people to add to the project.
- If the user does not explicitly list services, you MUST analyze the project name and description to infer a list of relevant services from the 'Available Services' context and include them in the 'services' array. For example, a 'gala dinner' project might need 'Venue', 'Food & Beverage', and 'Entertainment'.

2. UPDATE_PROJECT:
{"action": "UPDATE_PROJECT", "project_name": "<project name>", "updates": {"field": "value", "another_field": "value"}}
- Valid fields for 'updates' are: name, description, status, payment_status, budget, start_date, due_date, venue, add_members, remove_members, add_services, remove_services, add_tags, remove_tags.
- For 'add_tags' and 'remove_tags', the value should be an array of tag names. If a tag doesn't exist, it will be created with a default color.

3. DELETE_PROJECT:
{"action": "DELETE_PROJECT", "project_name": "<name of project to delete>"}

4. CREATE_TASK:
{"action": "CREATE_TASK", "project_name": "<project name>", "task_title": "<title of the new task>", "assignees": ["<optional user name>"]}

5. ASSIGN_TASK:
{"action": "ASSIGN_TASK", "project_name": "<project name>", "task_title": "<title of the task>", "assignees": ["<user name 1>", "<user name 2>"]}

6. UNASSIGN_TASK:

- If a user provides only a title for a new goal, you MUST infer the other details.
- Infer a suitable 'description'.
- Choose an appropriate 'type' ('frequency', 'quantity', or 'value').
- Suggest a relevant 'icon' from the 'Available Icons' list and a suitable 'color'.
- Create 2-3 relevant 'tags' as an array of objects like '[{"name": "Health", "color": "#FF6B6B"}, {"name": "Hobby", "color": "#F7B801"}]'. These will be new tags.
- Example: User says "create a goal to learn guitar". You might respond with: {"action": "CREATE_GOAL", "goal_details": {"title": "Learn Guitar", "description": "Practice guitar regularly to improve skills.", "type": "frequency", "frequency": "Weekly", "specific_days": ["Mo", "We", "Fr"], "icon": "Music", "color": "#4ECDC4", "tags": [{"name": "Music", "color": "#4ECDC4"}, {"name": "Hobby", "color": "#F7B801"}]}}

{"action": "CREATE_ARTICLE", "article_details": {"title": "<article title>", "content": "<HTML content>", "folder_name": "<optional folder name>", "header_image_search_query": "<optional image search query>"}}
